A sample Go project created during a training. It includes simple examples of the usage of:

* The repository pattern
* file i/o
* JSON encoding and decoding
* Database access using Gorm
* Testing in Go
* A web API server using Gin
* TLS use in Gin
* A simple GRPC client and server

Eventually, it will be properly documented and annotated. (Commitment made on 2021-03-21)
