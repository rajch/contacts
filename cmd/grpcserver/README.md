# grpcserver

This demonstrates:
* an implementation of a GRPC server interface generated by the `protoc` compiler
* the repository pattern

## GRPC Server implementation

The `contactServer` struct defined in the *grpcserver.go* file implements the `ContactServiceServer` interface generated by the `protoc` compiler. An important detail is the embedding of a struct called `grpc.UnimplementedContactServiceServer`. The Go tooling for `protoc` includes this detail to ensure forward compatibility when modifying GRPC definitions.

## Repository pattern
The GRPC server can store contact data in a json file or a sqlite database. The code uses the Repository interface provided by the contacts package. You can choose the actual repository inmplementation by changing the `getrepo` function defined at the end of *grpcserver.go*.
